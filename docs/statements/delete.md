# Delete

The `DELETE` statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

```
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition
```

> **Note:** Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the `WHERE` clause in the `DELETE` statement. The `WHERE` clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the `WHERE` clause, all records in the table will be deleted!
