# Order By

The `ORDER BY` keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order. The `ORDER BY` keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the `DESC` keyword.

```
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column DESC;
```

> **Note:** JSQL only supports ordering results by a single column.
